# Plan for n8n-ai: A NestJS-based Workflow Automation Platform

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the plan for building `n8n-ai`, a next-generation, enterprise-grade workflow automation platform. The entire platform will be built using NestJS, ensuring a consistent, maintainable, and scalable codebase. This project will be a clone of n8n, but with a more robust and modern architecture from the ground up, focusing on developer experience, security, and performance.

## 2. Core Principles

The architecture will be guided by the following principles:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** The application will be structured around business domains to ensure a clear separation of concerns.
- **SOLID Principles:** The code will adhere to SOLID principles for maintainability and scalability.
- **Microservices Ready:** The modular design will allow for easy extraction of services into microservices in the future.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Asynchronous communication between components will be a core feature, using message queues.
- **CQRS Pattern:** We will separate read and write models for performance optimization where necessary.
- **Multi-Tenancy:** The platform will be designed with multi-tenancy in mind from the start.

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Framework:** NestJS with TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with TypeORM
- **Cache:** Redis for caching, session storage, and real-time updates.
- **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ for asynchronous task processing.
- **API Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI for auto-generated, interactive API documentation.
- **Containerization:** Docker for development and Kubernetes for production deployment.

## 4. Project Structure

The project will follow a well-organized, domain-driven structure within the `n8n-ai` directory:

```
n8n-ai/
├── src/
│   ├── app.module.ts
│   ├── main.ts
│   ├── config/                     # Configuration management

└── nest-cli.json
```

## 5. Core Modules Implementation Plan

Each domain will be a full-featured NestJS module.

1.  **Credentials Module:** Secure credential storage with AES-256-GCM encryption, OAuth 2.0 support, and multi-tenant isolation.
2.  **Workflows Module:** Core workflow management, including versioning, validation, and a visual editor API.
3.  **Executions Module:** Real-time execution tracking, retry mechanisms, and performance analytics.
4.  **Scheduling Module:** Cron-based and interval-based workflow scheduling with timezone support.
5.  **Webhooks Module:** Dynamic webhook generation, security validation, and rate limiting.
6.  **AI Agents Module:** Integration with AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and local models.
7.  **Monitoring Module:** Real-time system and application monitoring with custom dashboards.
8.  **Plugin Marketplace Module:** A secure marketplace for discovering and managing community and enterprise plugins.
9.  **Authentication & Users:** JWT-based authentication, user management, and RBAC.
10. **Tenants Module:** For multi-tenancy support.
11. **Audit Module:** For comprehensive audit trails.

## 6. API Design

- A comprehensive RESTful API will be exposed for all resources.
- The API will be documented using Swagger/OpenAPI, and the documentation will be available at `/api-docs`.
- The API will be versioned from the start (e.g., `/api/v1/...`).

## 7. Security

- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens.
- **Encryption:** AES-256-GCM encryption for all sensitive data at rest (e.g., credentials).
- **Input Validation:** Use of `class-validator` for all incoming DTOs.
- **Security Best Practices:** Adherence to OWASP Top 10 and other security best practices.

## 8. Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy will be implemented:

- **Unit Tests (Jest):** For testing individual services, controllers, and utilities.
- **Integration Tests:** For testing module interactions and database operations.
- **E2E Tests (Supertest):** For testing the full application flow from API endpoint to the database.
- **CI/CD:** A GitHub Actions pipeline will be set up to run all tests on every push and pull request.

## 9. Deployment

- **Docker:** The application will be fully containerized with a multi-stage Dockerfile for optimized production images.
- **Kubernetes:** The application will be designed to be deployed on Kubernetes, with Helm charts provided for easy deployment.

## 10. Phased Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)**
- Set up the NestJS project with the defined structure.
- Implement core infrastructure modules (config, common, database).
- Implement basic Authentication and User modules.

**Phase 2: Core Workflow Functionality (Weeks 3-6)**
