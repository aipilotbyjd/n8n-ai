# Project Status

This document outlines the current status of the n8n-clone project, detailing completed work, partially implemented features, and pending tasks.

## Overall Vision

The project aims to create a scalable, enterprise-grade workflow automation platform, similar to n8n. The architecture is based on microservices, with a NestJS-based orchestrator and execution engine, and a separate service for sandboxed node execution.

## Completed Architectural Design

*   **Core Architecture:** A microservices architecture has been designed with `orchestrator-nest` as the control plane and a dedicated execution engine.
*   **Technology Stack:** The technology stack is well-defined, centered around NestJS, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, and RabbitMQ.
*   **Domain-Driven Design:** The `orchestrator-nest` service is structured using domain-driven design, with clear boundaries for modules like `workflows`, `credentials`, `executions`, etc.
*   **Advanced Features:** The architecture includes plans for advanced features like AI agents, a plugin marketplace, and real-time monitoring.
*   **Security:** Security is a core consideration, with plans for JWT authentication, data encryption, and multi-tenancy.

## Partially Implemented Features

Based on the file structure, the following modules in `orchestrator-nest` have been started:

*   `auth`
*   `credentials`
*   `executions`
*   `scheduling`
*   `webhooks`
*   `ai-agents`
*   `monitoring`
*   `plugin-marketplace`
*   `audit`

## Completed Implementations

*   **`engine-nest` service:**
    *   Basic structure of the engine is in place.
    *   Connects to RabbitMQ and consumes execution jobs.
    *   Includes a `DagService` for parsing workflows and determining execution order.
    *   Includes a `NodeDispatcherService` for dispatching nodes to `node-runner-js`.
    *   Includes an `ExecutionStateService` for managing execution state.
*   **`node-runner-js` service:**
    *   Basic structure is in place.
    *   Connects to RabbitMQ and consumes node execution jobs.
    *   Uses `isolated-vm` for sandboxed code execution.
*   **Inter-service Communication:**
    *   RabbitMQ connection is established between `orchestrator-nest` and `engine-nest` for workflow execution requests.
    *   RabbitMQ connection is established between `engine-nest` and `node-runner-js` for node execution requests and responses.
*   **Database Schemas and Entities:**
    *   TypeORM entities for `workflows`, `executions`, and `users` are well-defined.
*   **Workflow Management in `orchestrator-nest`:**
    *   API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, deleting, activating, deactivating, and duplicating workflows are implemented.
    *   A new endpoint `POST /workflows/:id/execute` is added to trigger workflow executions.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   Basic `login` and `register` functionality with password hashing and JWT token generation is implemented in `AuthService`.
    *   `JwtStrategy` is implemented for JWT token validation.
    *   `JwtAuthGuard` is applied to `WorkflowsController`, `ExecutionsController`, and protected routes in `AuthController`.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:**
    *   A comprehensive global exception filter is implemented in `orchestrator-nest`.
*   **Testing:**
    *   Basic unit tests are implemented for `AuthService`.

## Pending Implementation

*   **`engine-go` to `engine-nest` Migration:** The original plan mentioned an `engine-go` service, but the master plan indicates a shift to a unified NestJS stack with `engine-nest`. The `engine-nest` service exists but appears to be a skeleton. This is a major pending item.
*   **Node Runner:** The `node-runner-js` service, responsible for sandboxed node execution, is part of the plan but not present in the file structure.
*   **Inter-service Communication:** The communication between services using RabbitMQ needs to be implemented.
*   **Database Schema and Migrations:** The database schema for all the domains needs to be fully defined and migration scripts created.
*   **Core Business Logic:** While the module structure is in place, the core business logic for many domains (e.g., workflow execution, scheduling) is likely incomplete.
*   **Testing:** A comprehensive testing suite (unit, integration, E2E) needs to be written.
*   **UI:** There is no UI implementation mentioned.

## Next Steps

The next steps will focus on refining the existing implementations and building out the remaining core functionalities.

1.  **Implement Core Business Logic:** Focus on completing the core business logic within the existing modules, especially for workflow execution, scheduling, and data flow between nodes.
2.  **Database Migrations:** Create and run database migrations to ensure the schemas are correctly applied.
3.  **Testing:** Continue writing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for the implemented features.
4.  **Error Handling and Logging:** Enhance error handling and logging across all services for better observability.
